# AlphaPi

AlphaPi is a plain text device that has two apps: word processor and chatbot.

See it in action here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AlphaPi/comments/1g417sg/alphapi_v2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button

`128x32oled.py` is meant to be used with the Adafruit 2.23" Monochrome OLED Bonnet (https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-2-23-monochrome-oled-bonnet/overview).

`gfxhat.py` is meant to be used with the GFX HAT (https://www.pishop.us/product/gfx-hat-128x64-lcd-display-with-rgb-backlight-and-touch-buttons/).

The case I use is `alphapi.stl`. Will modify in the future for other configurations.
